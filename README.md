# guess-these-tunes (not working anymore, needs update)
## A song-guessing game that connects to the iTunes API, plays songs based on the selected genres and saves user's score to yield a ranking of the best users.

This project was developed for the Android course at University of Trento, back in 2010.

It was my first time developing an Android application, an interesting experience!
